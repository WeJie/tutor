Aliyun Kubernetes deployment is currently an alpha feature, and we are hard at work to make it 100% reliable üõ†Ô∏è If you are interested in deploying Open edX to Kubernetes, please get in touch! Your input will be much appreciated.

Requirements
------------
- One aliyun Kubernetes cluster
- Aliyun NAS(Network Attached Storage) service

----------

Launch the platform on k8s in 1 click::

All Kubernetes resources are associated to ALIYUN_NAMESPACE of conifg.yml.


Upgrading
---------

After pulling updates from the Tutor repository, you can apply changes with::

    tutor aliyun stop
    tutor aliyun start


To Do list
----------
- Can't delete PersistentVolume via `tutor aliyun delete`
- Better way to deal with ALIYUN_STORAGE_SERVER and ALIYUN_NAMESPACE
- Support specify namspace via command line argument
- Generate random namspace for every different deployment

For now, the following features from the local deployment are not supported:
